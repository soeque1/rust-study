// To get started with the course, open the file `part00.rs` in this workspace as well
// as its [fully explained version](https://www.ralfj.de/projects/rust-101/part00.html).
// The code below is mostly boilerplate to dispatch into the various parts of the
// tutorial.

// Only the files imported here will be compiled.
mod part00;

// This decides which part is actually run.
